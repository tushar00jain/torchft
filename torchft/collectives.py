    """
    Performs a quantized all-reduce operation on a list of tensors.

    This function implements an optimized all-reduce that reduces communication
    overhead by quantizing tensors to FP8 format before sending them over the
    network. The algorithm works as follows:

    1. Quantize input tensors to FP8 format
    2. Distribute chunks of quantized tensors to all ranks using all-to-all
    3. Reduce chunks locally in higher precision after dequantization
    4. Collect reduced chunks from all ranks using all-gather
    5. Dequantize the result back to the original precision

    This implementation only supports the AVG reduce operation.

    Args:
        tensors: List of tensors to be reduced. All tensors must be on the same
            CUDA device and have the same dtype.
        opts: Options for the all-reduce operation. Can be either an
            AllreduceOptions object or a ReduceOp enum. If a ReduceOp is
            provided, it must be ReduceOp.AVG.
        process_group: The process group to perform the all-reduce on.
        sync_stream: Optional CUDA stream to use for synchronization. If None,
            a new stream will be created.

    Returns:
        A Future that can be used to wait for the operation to complete and
        clean up intermediate buffers.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If the reduce operation is not ReduceOp.AVG.
